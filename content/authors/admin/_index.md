Hi, I am Raymond. I am a fourth year mathematics PhD student at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu), where I am advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/). I was also an undergraduate at UCLA studying Applied Mathematics, where I was advised by [Professor Marcus Roper](https://www.marcusroper.org).

I am honored to have recieved the [Horn Moez Prize](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/departmental-awards/) (2021) from UCLA Mathematics for my high academic achivements and an [Honorable Mention](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) (2022) in the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. I have also recieved a teaching award [Liggett Fellow Award](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/departmental-awards/) (2023) from UCLA Mathematics.
